# 🎤 Voice-Based RAG Q&A System

🚀 Overview

The Voice-Based RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Q&A System is an advanced AI-powered assistant that enables users to ask questions via voice input and receive detailed, context-aware answers. This project integrates speech recognition, generative AI, and a RAG pipeline to enhance response accuracy by retrieving relevant information before generating an answer.

🎯 Features

✅ Voice Input - Ask questions using voice commands.
✅ Speech-to-Text (STT) - Converts spoken words into text.
✅ RAG Pipeline - Retrieves relevant documents before generating answers.
✅ LLM Integration - Utilizes state-of-the-art language models.
✅ Multi-language Support - Works with multiple languages for global usability.
